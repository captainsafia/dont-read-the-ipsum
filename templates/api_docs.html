        <h3> Query from Twitter </h3>
        <p> 
            The <code>/api/comment/ipsum/twitter</code> endpoint allows you to
            fetch a random ipsum text generator from an account's tweets or
            replies to their tweets. The API takes in a value <b>count</b>
            which represents the number of <b>count_type</b> that you would
            like returned. Note that <b>count_type</b> can only be <b>char</b>
            or <b>word</b>, in another value is provided the API will automatically
            default to <b>word</b> as the <b>count_type</b>. The endpoint also takes
            a value <b>source</b> which is the account's username without the "@"
            symbol in the front. The final parameter is <b>tweets_or_replies</b>,
            which can contain either the values "tweets" or "replies". If it is 
            set to "tweets" the API will generate ipsum from the account's own 
            tweets and if it is set to "replies" the API will generate ipsum from
            the replies to that account's tweets.
        </p>

            fetch a random ipsum generated from the comments on a Reddit
            submission. The API takes in a value <b>count</b> which represents
            the number of <b>count_type</b> that you would like returned. Note
            that <b>count_type</b> can only be <b>char</b> or <b>word</b>, if
            another value is provided the API will automatically default to
            <b>word</b> as the value for <b>count_type</b>. The endpoint also
            takes a value <b>source</b> which is the short URL for the reddit
            submission that you wish to generate ipsum from. The short URL will
            typically look like "https://redd.it/XXXXX" where the XXXXX is the ID
            of that particular Reddit thread.
